# _prolog
## tldr;
Prolog and microcontrollers seem like they should be a natural fit.  Prolog makes excellent expert systems with it's
rules, facts and inference engine, while a microcontroller is a closed-loop system that uses input from the real world, 
compares it to a set of rules to decide how to influence the world around it.

Sounds like a pretty good match to me.

## Getting Started
I'm still getting started, so I'll let you know what to do when I figure that out.
