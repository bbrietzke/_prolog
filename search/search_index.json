Why? The idea does seem more than a little crazy, I'll be the first to admit it. Given Prolog's nature as a rules based nature, where as a developer or engineer assigns facts and creates rules which are bound together with relationships that are then consulted with to find an answer it seems like a like an ideal way to build a closed-system system with a given challenge domain. Most programs that run on microcontrollers are designed to take external inputs (i.e. temperatures, switches, etc.), consult an internal logic set to do something such as turn on a light, or activate a fan. For example, the processor in your computer is a heat generating device that is enclosed in a shell or case that does not provide much airflow. In most situations, you will have a fan or heat sink that will help mitigate the heat build up. It is a microcontroller of some variety that will keep tabs on the controller temperature either through a sensor or talking with the processor directly and will decided to activate a fan when the processor gets within certain heat thresholds. If the processor temperature gets over a critical threshold, an alarm may be triggered to turn off the system as a whole before irreparable damage is done. That pretty much sounds like an rules engine to me. This engine is more than likely coded in C with a jumbled mess of if/then/else statements interspersed with function calls to turn on or off GPIO ports to use PWM to control fans or activate LEDs to notify the operator. This engine will be uploaded or flashed to the microcontroller so that it can do it's job of keeping the processor safe. There is nothing wrong with writing such an engine in C. If fact, it's being done that way across billions of microcontroller and installed on millions of devices. C is comparatively easy programming language to learn and use and is still one of the most popular languages out in the wild today. But does that means it's the best?
